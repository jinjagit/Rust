// Itâ€™s possible to return multiple values using a tuple, as shown:

// Filename: src/main.rs

// fn main() {
//     let s1 = String::from("hello");

//     let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

//     println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
// }

// fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
//     let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

//     (s, length)
// }

// But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept
// that should be common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for
// this concept, called 'references'.
